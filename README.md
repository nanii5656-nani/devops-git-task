# DevOps Git Task

This project demonstrates how to use Git and GitHub for version control.  
It includes creating branches, making commits, merging with pull requests,  
adding tags, and writing documentation.


## 📁 Project Structure — Step by step

1. `devops-git-task/`  
   Root folder for the assignment.

2. `├── README.md`  
   - This file. Provides overview, objectives, usage and notes.

3. `├── TASK_DOCUMENTATION.md`  
   - Step-by-step documentation of the Git tasks you performed: branch creation, commits, pull requests, merges, tags, and how you resolved conflicts. Use this file to show command examples and screenshots.

4. `├── .gitignore`  
   - Lists files and patterns to exclude from version control (e.g., `node_modules/`, build artifacts, `.env` files). Prevents committing sensitive or noisy files.

5. `├── hello.sh`  
   - A small shell script used to demonstrate committing and running code. Example contents:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     echo "Hello from devops-git-task!"
     ```
   - Make executable before testing: `chmod +x hello.sh`
